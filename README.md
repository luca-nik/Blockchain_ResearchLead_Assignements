# Tasks
My solutions to the tasks for the role of Research & Business Development Lead at C11 labs.

## How to use this repo
In [this pdf](Solutions.pdf) you will find the detailed solutions to each task I have selected (2, 3, 5).

In each folder, you can find the Python codes used to solve/make plots for the different exercises.

First, install all the dependencies running:
```@console 
./installation.sh
```
And then you can run the code associated to each exercise with:
```@console
  cd exerciseXXX
  poetry run python src/main.py
```
